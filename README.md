# 📊 YouTube Sentiment Analysis | Data‑Driven Content Strategy Using NLP

A data analytics & NLP project focused on **understanding real audience emotions from YouTube comments** to help creators and social media agencies decide *what content to create next*—based on data, not guesswork.

This project analyzes thousands of comments from the **Jake Paul vs Mike Tyson fight trailer** to uncover emotional patterns, dominant themes, and audience perception that directly influence engagement and content performance.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Content creators constantly face questions like:

* *What should my next video be about?*
* *Will the audience engage or scroll past?*
* *Should I follow trends or create something original?*

Most decisions are based on intuition or copying competitors, which often leads to **missed first‑mover advantage**.

In this project, I used **Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to extract **raw audience sentiment** from YouTube comments—turning unstructured text into actionable insights for content strategy.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Creators and agencies struggle with:

* Lack of clarity on **what themes truly resonate** with audiences
* Difficulty predicting **how a video might perform before publishing**
* Overreliance on trends rather than audience emotions
* Noise in comment sections (emojis, slang, sarcasm) hiding real opinions

Without sentiment-driven insights, content planning remains reactive instead of strategic.

---

## 🎯 Objective of the Analysis

To build a sentiment analysis system that:

* Extracts **positive, negative, and neutral emotions** from YouTube comments
* Identifies **themes driving engagement** (excitement, nostalgia, doubt, criticism)
* Helps predict **content reception** based on audience sentiment
* Enables creators to design content using **data-backed emotional cues**
